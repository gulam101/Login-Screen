### Description:
I created this project at the start of 2019. At this time, I was new to using HTML. I started creating a login screen because I had a rough understanding of how to create one and since every website utilised a login page, I thought it would be a great place to start.

The simple login page was created just for design so that I could get a better understanding of HTML. This project also taught me about how to design a web page using HTML and styling it using CSS. This was also my first time using the ATOM IDE because I had used an online IDE that allowed me to create simple webpages using any web language.
